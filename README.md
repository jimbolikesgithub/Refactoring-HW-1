# Refactoring-HW-1

 --- This project had us refactoring code that was unnecessary and redundant/repetitive. We also had to comment our changes and/or code that SHOULD be organized for better readability. We also had to add a README file and push everything to our main repo on Github. ---

* Changed some of the classes for better use in CSS (took away ALOT of redundancy).

style.css -
